*Client Reference*
==================

This page refers to the :obj:`~tglib.Client` and all its methods, which are the same described in the
`official documentation <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods>`_, changed from camelCase to snake_case.
E.g. sendMessage becomes send_message

.. autoclass:: tglib.Client
